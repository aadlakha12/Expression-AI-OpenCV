# Face-Expression-Detection-Opencv

Face expression detection is based on the Convolutional neural network architecture. It uses a dataset from kaggle fers2013.csv. https://www.kaggle.com/ahmedmoorsy/facial-expression

It is implemented in tensorflow. Model is trained on this dataset. And it uses opencv to detect the human face. 
A input is given to the model through webcam to predict the expression.

It uses haarcascade_frontai_default.xml to detect the face.
